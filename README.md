# PokeShare Suite

PokeShare is a modern platform for Pokémon trainers to effortlessly create, visualize, and share their Pokémon Showdown teams.

## Features

*   **Two Ways to Build**: Paste a team from Pokémon Showdown for quick sharing, or use the intuitive visual Studio to build a team from scratch.
*   **Beautifully Shareable**: Every team gets a unique, shareable link that displays the team in a clean, modern, and easy-to-read format.
*   **Customization**: Personalize your experience with a theme toggle and an accent color picker.
*   **Team History**: Keep track of all the teams you've created on your device with the "My Teams" history sidebar.
*   **Fast and Reliable**: Powered by Firebase for secure and fast backend storage, and a local data cache (`dittoDB`) for quick loading times.

## How to Use

### Creating Teams (The Classic Way)

The quickest way to share a team is through the main page.

1.  **Author & Team Name**: Add your name and a title for your team.
2.  **Showdown Paste**: Copy your team from the Pokémon Showdown teambuilder and paste it into the text area.
3.  **Generate Link**: Click "Generate Share Link" to save your team and get a unique URL to share.

### Creating Teams (The Visual Way)

For a more hands-on approach, head over to the **PokeShare Studio**.

The Studio provides a rich, visual interface for building your team from the ground up. Select your Pokémon, assign moves, abilities, items, and distribute EVs with an intuitive user interface. Once your team is ready, you can export it to get your shareable link.

### Viewing and Sharing Teams

Every generated link leads to a beautifully designed view page that showcases your team. All the important details, from stats and abilities to moves and types, are presented in a clean, easy-to-read format. Just send the link to your friends, and they'll see your team exactly as you intended.

## Customization

PokeShare is designed to be visually pleasing, and you can customize it to your liking.

*   **Accent Color**: Click the colored circle in the top-left corner to open a color picker and change the site's accent color.
*   **Theme Toggle**: While the site defaults to a sleek dark mode, a theme toggle is available to switch to a light theme if you prefer.

## My Teams (History)

The "My Teams" button in the top-right corner opens a sidebar that contains a history of all the teams you've created on your current device. This allows you to quickly access and re-share your previous creations.
